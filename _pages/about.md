I'm an undergraduate student from [Department of Physic](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Scientific Machine leaning (SciML), AI for Partial Differential Equations (AI4PDEs) and Physics for AI (Physics4AI). 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Lu Lu](https://lugroup.yale.edu/) at [Department of Statistics and Data Science ](https://statistics.yale.edu/), Yale University. 

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
