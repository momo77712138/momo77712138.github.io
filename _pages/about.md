I'm an final year undergraduate student from [Department of Physic](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Scientific Machine leaning (SciML), AI for Partial Differential Equations and AI for Science. I'm particularly interested in applying machine leanring to PDE systems. 

I am very fortunate to cooperate with [Prof. Lu Lu](https://lugroup.yale.edu/) at [Department of Statistics and Data Science ](https://statistics.yale.edu/), Yale University. Currently, I'm a visiting student at [School of Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/)(CSE), Georgia Tech, working with [Prof. Peng Chen](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~pchen402/).
